      "content": "# Installing and Configuring Microsoft SQL Server: A Comprehensive Guide\r\n\r\nThis will be a walkthrough of the process of installing and setting up Microsoft SQL Server. This guide is designed to assist individuals looking into database management. Let's dive into the steps:\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Download Microsoft SQL Server\r\n\r\n- Visit the official Microsoft SQL Server download page.\r\n- Choose the appropriate edition for your needs (Year, operating system), and click on the download link for the developer version since it has free licensing for development and testing.\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Installation Process\r\n\r\n- Run the downloaded executable file to initiate the installation process.\r\n- For installation type, I would recommend you opt for the basic installation for a standard setup, but you can choose custom for more control over your features.\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Feature Selection\r\n\r\n- Select the features you want to install. I would recommend Database Engine Services, SQL Server Replication, and Full-Text and Semantic Extractions. However, feel free to customize and tailor these to your needs.\r\n\r\n## Step 4: Instance Configuration\r\n\r\n- Specify the instance configuration, including whether you want to install a default instance or a named instance. If choosing a named instance, provide a unique name.\r\n\r\n### What’s an instance?\r\n\r\nAn instance is essentially a distinct installation of the SQL Server database engine on a server, with default instances being simpler and using the default port, while named instances allow for multiple independent installations with unique configurations. For the sake of simplicity and people new to SQL server, I would recommend you opt for a default instance.\r\n\r\n## Step 5: Server Configuration\r\n\r\n- Configure the server by establishing authentication modes, choosing between Windows Authentication or Mixed Mode. This step is for securing your database and preventing unauthorized access.\r\n- If you are using a shared computer, opt for Mixed Mode to require both Windows Authentication and a password for the system administrator account.\r\n- On a personal computer, you can use Windows Authentication for a simpler login process.\r\n\r\n## Step 6: Database Engine Configuration\r\n\r\nThis step involves configuring server-wide settings, such as SQL Server administrators and data directories. Use default configurations if you're unsure or customize based on project requirements. Consider data directory locations and SQL Server administrators for optimal performance.\r\n\r\n## Step 7: Installation\r\n\r\n- Review the summary of your configurations and proceed with the installation. This process may take some time.\r\n\r\n**Congratulations!** You've now successfully installed and configured Microsoft SQL Server. This powerful database management system opens up a world of possibilities for data storage and retrieval. Remember to stay informed about the latest updates and best practices in SQL Server administration. Happy coding with Microsoft SQL Server!",

      "description": "An overview of what makes Bloggy tick.",
      "content": "To create bloggy we have used a variety of languages, frameworks, and libraries. In this post I will explain what each tool does, and why we have used it to create Bloggy!\r\n\r\n## Frontend\r\n\r\n### HTML\r\n\r\nHTML or Hyper Text Markup Language makes up the skeleton of Bloggy. Most of the actual content that is displayed on Bloggy is not located within the HTML files directly however.\r\n\r\n### CSS\r\n\r\nCSS is what describes the way Bloggy should look. We are using vanilla CSS with no preprocessors or frameworks. To do this we are simply using one stylesheet that describes all of bloggy, and we make use of classes and id's where appropriate.\r\n\r\n### JavaScript\r\n\r\nJavaScript is where much of the on screen magic happens for Bloggy. We use four main JavaScript files. Each HTML page has it's own JS file that gives it special functionality.\r\n\r\nFor our home page in particular, we have implemented a technique called **Lazy Loading** that loads in new blog posts as the user scrolls down. This ensures that resources are saved, page load speeds are improved and it gives the impression of an infinite scroll!\r\n\r\n### JSON\r\n\r\nWe use JSON as a flexible and easy way to organize and store our blogs on Bloggy. It enables us to quickly store and retrieve our blogs in an easy to read format.\r\n\r\n## Backend\r\n\r\n### Node.js\r\n\r\nNode.js is a powerful runtime that expands JavaScript into a full stack language! Node enables us to write backend in JavaScript that can easily integrate with the frontend.\r\n\r\nNode is fast, scalable and efficient which is perfect for Bloggy. It also gives us access to the huge ecosytem of **NPM** which allows us to quickly and easily modulate Bloggy with various free tools and libraries!\r\n\r\n### Express.js\r\n\r\nExpress is a web framework for Node.js that greatly simplifies the server creation process. It can handle HTTP requests and responses across our application and can interact directly with a database (coming soon)!\r\nThis means that Bloggy is a server-side rendered application!\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n\r\n### Multer\r\n\r\nMulter is a middleware tool that we use with Express and Node to allow users to upload images to Bloggy.\r\n\r\n### EasyMDE\r\n\r\nEasyMDE is an awesome all-in-one text editor that we use for Bloggy's New Post page. It allows users to quickly style and mark up their blogs, and preview how it will appear before submission!\r\nIt really makes it easy to write blog posts directly in MarkDown\r\n\r\n### MD-Block\r\n\r\nMD-Block is nice little library that we use to display formatted text as MarkDown. This allows us to save the blog posts as plain text files and convert them as needed to simplify the development process.\r\n\r\n### Cropper.js\r\n\r\nCropper is a library that does what it suggests, crops images. We use Cropper to allow users to upload images of any size and cut them down if needed to display properly on Bloggy. This way users do not need to worry about what size their images are.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis has been a quick overview of the tech stack that makes up Bloggy! As we continue to develop and grow Bloggy we will be sure to update this list.",
